# Another TO DO LIST (yes)

## Description

This is a simple ToDo List application built with React and Vite. The application allows users to add, update, delete, and filter tasks, providing a functional and interactive experience. It demonstrates how to manage state in React using the useState hook, which has helped me improve my understanding of React's component lifecycle and state management.

### Learning Objectives

During this project, I learned:

- React Basics: Understanding components, props, and state management.
- Using Hooks: How to use useState and useEffect for managing state and side effects in functional components.
- Event Handling: Managing user input and actions through events.
- Local Storage: Storing and retrieving data from the browserâ€™s local storage to persist tasks between sessions.
- Accessibility: Making the application keyboard-navigable and using ARIA roles for better accessibility.

### Features

- *Add* new tasks, *update* and *delete*
- Keyboard accessibility

### Technologies Used

- **React**
- **Vite**
- **Framer Motion:** For animations when adding or removing tasks.
- **React Icons:** For icons in the user interface.
- **React Toastify:** For notifications to inform users about actions.

### Install

##### Install depedencies

### Future Improvements and Refactoring Plans
This project was a great start for me to explore React fundamentals, but there are several areas where I plan to make enhancements :

#### Code Refactoring
- Component Decomposition
- Custom Hooks
- Prop Types and Type Checkin

#### Enhanced Features
- Search and Filter Functionality
- Task Categories and Prioritization
- Due Date and Reminders
- Dark Mode Toggle

#### Improved Accessibility
